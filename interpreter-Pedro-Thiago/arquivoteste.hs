To correct the error Parser.hs:1198:36: error: Couldn't match expected type Expr' with actual type Token', you need to make sure that the argument happy_var_3' passed to the Pair' function is of type Expr' and not Token'.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

typescript
Copy code
pair :: Parser Expr
pair = do
  symbol "("
  e1 <- expr
  symbol ","
  e2 <- expr
  symbol ")"
  return $ Pair e1 e2

In this corrected code, the pair function uses the expr parser to parse the two expressions inside the parentheses. The type of e1 and e2 is Expr, and they are passed as arguments to the Pair constructor. This will resolve the type mismatch error, and the code should now work as expected.
